<h2>DO YOU KNOW? BY GRACE</h2>
Do you know dear girl, that your body is the temple of God and you can please God, as His temple you're by keeping yourself undefiled.Don't you know you can control the normal sexual urge because when you have God's spirit in you, you can obviously control it, when you feel the urge.God is wise and He knows what you want; so remove that impression that you will sleep with your man to know the size of his penis before you can marry him or you want to show him love; sex is not love.Using other things like; unripe banana, plantain etc to satisfy yourself is too dangerous and risky. Just imagine when it breaks inside your Virgina. Dear unmarried girl say no to sex before marriage.Whenever you feel that urge, just screamin your heart or loudly "GOD HELP ME OR HOLY SPIRIT HELP ME.</li><br>

<p><h2>Uwaa..  Uwaa..</h2></p> 
When we're born<br>
That we're come<br> 
We cry uwaa..  Uwaa..<br> 

<p>To the craziness of the world,<br> 
To the craziness we'll face,<br> 
And to the facing of life race,<br> 
We cry uwaa.. Uwaa..</p> 

<p>To the hard time that's to come,<br> 
To to the works we'll at home,<br>
To the school; perhaps schooled,<br> 
We cry uwaa.. Uwaa..</p> 

<p>To some; will be courageous,<br> 
To some; will be harmonious,<br>
While facing circumstance;<br>
We cry uwaa.. Uwaa..</p> 

<p>To some; will be poignant,<br> 
To some; will be discordent,<br> 
Because of their predicament;<br>
We cry uwaa.. Uwaa..</p> 

<p>And to the why the wicked prosper;<br>
The kindhearted miscarry;<br>
Laughing at last; the wicked face suffer,<br> 
We cry uwaa..  Uwaa..</p> 

<p>When we're born,<br> 
We cry because we come;<br>
To the inevitable that will return us,<br> 
Uwaa.. Uwaa.. We cry. </p><br>
<h2 id="poem by grace">POEM BY GRACE</h2>
<i>Their preaching wasn't pellucid;<br>
their face was nothing bonhomie<br> 
and after their bitter words that made me not willing to be seen in them,<br> 
so they forcefully converted me.<br> 
They converted me to their never finding peacehood.<br> 
I was forced to speak their not interesting language;<br> 
I also, was forced to act in their wicked manners;<br> 
they gave me lashes.<br> 
Lashes that my mom told me <br>"Jesus took for me before I was born"<br>
the lashes were too hurt that it left scars on me<br> 
and I was given a mark on my neck.<br> A mark that will be till eternity.<br> 
The oath to leave and die or to stay and live; <br>
of which I choose to stay and live<br>but live in a never peaceful and achieving life,<br> 
so swimming in the sweet river of evil after capsizing into it,<br> 
but still wishing to make mama proud.<br> 
Wishing to make mama proud as the only son.<br> 
So one day, I remembered that Man;<br>
A Man that's still in the business of restoration.<br> 
A Man that took my lashes before I was born;<br>
The one that's knocking at your heart door to let Him in,<br> 
So that, peace will be still in you.<br> 
Then I cried out to this never deaf Man, who answered me<br> 
and I let my heart door open again;<br> He came in and peace is still.<br> 
But I still get upset when I see the mark I never wanted<br>
Is tasting evil ever sweet?<br>
I want to give myself but<br>
I think I still have guilt<br> Guilt am sure would soon subside</i>

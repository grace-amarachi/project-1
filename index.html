<b><i>Hello world web design training!</i></b><br>
what do you know about <b>SKILLS</b>? For me, it is a certificate that can't be taken away from you. university might be burned, and you don't have any other prima facie else where, you will be presumed not a university graduate unless the ones university has gone <b>through them</b>. Not surprise that there people school didn't go through them but they went <b>through school</b><br>some go to school and come back with a very beautiful result they can't defend, some go and come back with a very beautiful result they can defend and while some go and come back with a bad result which their mind is richer than. <i>well that mystery is what I can mot explain</i>
<p>some that come out with the result they think they don't deserve can literally live in anger or maybe regret and the most impressive are those who don't even care but would focus rather on doing better with their lives and you see them winning in the everyday life.</p>

<i style="color:darkgoldenrod;">The more you study the word of God is the more you do the right thing as a christian</i>As christians, we need to depend on the <b>HOLY SPIRIT</b> to be able to carry out our purpose. Even Jesus when He wore the form of man; when He removed everything <i><b>DIVINITY</b></i> to come die on the cross for our sin, He depended on the SPIRIT OF GOD. This is shown after He was baptised by JOHN at river Jordan; the Spirit of God came and rested on Him like a <i style="color:yellow;">DOVE. </i>My Abba Father in HEAVEN, I totally depend on you for your direction in this untold earth.
